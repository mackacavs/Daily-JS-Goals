# Daily Goal Checker

In my challenges to learn Javascript I decided to complete 2 goals in 1-

* Find an easy-to-use place to put all of my daily goals. 
* Develop a program using mongodb and express - whilst continuing to hone my Javascript skills.

With this in mind I've created a very simple daily goals app. It uses mongoDB for the database and Express for the server.

# How To Install

* Clone the program onto your local machine
* Install the packages in package.json through NPM
* Download mongo db onto your local machine if you haven't done so already
* Type 'nodemon' into your terminal in order to run the server on webport 5000
